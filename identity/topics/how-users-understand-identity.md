# How users understand identity

// DRAFT

Lack of great user experiences is often raised as one of decentralized identity's (and blockchain's) missing ingredients for ubiquitous adoption. However to arrive at usable experiences across the industry, we first need to reach consensus around basic user personas and mental models, then design and build interoperable system accordingly.
In "the internet's missing identity layer" we took a stab at an acceptable set of personas and solution criteria.
To arrive at an acceptable set of user mental models, we can first start by observing how users already interact with identity concepts in their day-to-day economic activities, and the artifacts they use to do this. This article represents an attempt to arrive at these models through basic observation and first principles.
Summary
In order to design usable identity systems and solutions for consumers, it is important to understand how identity concepts and artifacts are already being used to accomplish day-to-day tasks, as well as how they integrate with human cognition, at both intuitive, and reflective levels of thinking.
Identity and economic activity
Economists have a way of observing and evaluating all human activity based on the economic surplus produced. Although this viewpoint can be myopic and amoral, it is a useful lens for assessing the underlying reality of the world.
Looking through this lens, we can organize human activities as hierarchic structures ultimately supporting transactions with positive surplus. This can result in the oversimplified but helpful observation that all sustainable forms of activity directly or indirectly contribute to value creation.
Transaction support activity structureRole of identity systems
Much of the activities related to identity systems and security administration of the processes leading up to the final transactions, are ultimately useful in preventing (or mitigating against) a negative and undesirable outcome in place of a positive completion of a productive transaction. Think preventing the chance of outcomes such as fraud, or outright theft.
Identity systems are commonly used by groups of people to optimize social interactions between people and organization. These systems function by securely representing the identities of people, organizations and things and by allowing people to more easily identify, verify, connect, access, and interact by reducing the cost of these activities at scale.
Identity systems as transaction supportIdentity artifacts
Looking through the economic lens, identity systems and their corresponding artifacts are tools used to more easily perform economic activities and ultimately create value.
Existing landscape


Digital landscape
In the new digital most of the mentioned activities remain unchanged, however the artifacts used to accomplish them have become digital.
Mental models
Unfortunately most of the discussions taking place around identity do not represent a concerted effort to reduce to (and build on) a common and simplified user mental model. Identity concepts as discussed by the identity community are often complex and intellectually challenging. Identity concepts as instinctively understood by users on the other hand, have a much lower level of complexity. Even as users become more advanced in using identity tools, their understanding evolves from a simple model, to a moderately complex one.
At Universal Identity we use the analogy of tool, tool-belt and toolbox as a starting point, first to understand existing usage of physical identity artifacts to accomplish activities, and second to propose a set of corresponding digital identity concepts that users can more intuitively grasp and use.
