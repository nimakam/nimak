## Summary

## Internet architecture and history

The original internet protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, etc) as well as the world-wide web protocols (HTML, HTTP, etc) were all primarily designed to support a **universal information system**, one that enabled the sharing of **public information** in a **decentralized** and **permissionless** manner.

Web 1.0 came with its own elementary form of identity subsystem in the form of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), Domain Name Service (DNS) and X509 secure certificates. It was never designed to be a general purpose digital identity system, particularly for general consumer use cases.

Facing the said lack of a robust universal identity system, Web 2.0 companies such as **Facebook**, Google and others built their own **proprietary identity systems** to support their consumer content and social networking platforms. In the case of Facebook, their identity system was marketed to app developers as a **generalized web identity system**, at some benefit to the usability of those apps, but at the cost of **ceding developer and consumer power** to a rapidly growing Facebook.

The closest the internet came to defining a **semi-decentralized consumer identity system** was the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), that describes email addresses identifying individuals and mailboxes holding their information. However, per its design, this system has primarily been used for transferring email, as opposed to a general purpose identity system.

## A universal identity protocol

The internet needs and deserves a truly decentralized and generally usable identity system. We believe this need can only be fulfilled by an open, decentralized and permissionless protocol that supports a variety of applications and use cases to allow everyone to secure, manage and use their digital identities in a uniform standards-based manner.

A core building block of such a system are identity operator services which provide a home for each user's digital identity similar to how an email provider holding a user's emails. The identity protocol would have to designates the collection of identity operator services to be decentralized, such that the user can transfer their identity between operators at any time, with minimal friction.

## Identity owners

Although the most commonly used mode of using a ubiquitous identity protocol will be one operated on behalf of customers by 3rd-party identity providers, the protocol needs to support additional modes of operation for different audiences. Generally identity holders are closest to one of the following categories:

1. **Consumers** - prefer the highest degree of usability and lowest amount of effort, while maintaining a reasonable level of security and privacy.
2. **Early tech adopter** - prefer the highest degree of security, privacy and control over their identity, while maintaining a reasonable level of usability.
3. **Public organization** - separate their public facing identity from their internal systems, and generally prefer the highest degree of security and control over their public identity, with minimal privacy, while being OK with any additional effort needed.

Each of these identity owner profiles have their own set of preferences and requirements for operating their identity, most importantly around security, privacy and effort/usability.
