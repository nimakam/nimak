# What "identity" means

Every time people first hear about "identity" as my area of work, they confront me with the most perplexed and confounded expressions. Certainly this has something to do with the fact that "identity" is one of the more abstract and overloaded terms in the history of technology, business, humanities and sciences. It almost feels like it has become one of those buzz-words that confuses and impresses the audience enough to make them more susceptible to sales tactics. And so I set out to find a clear definition that would help me explain what it is.

## Summary

The simplest everyday definition of identity has to do with how we identify ourselves, and others. As such, identity is the information we mentally associate with ourselves, other people, entities, and objects.

The word "identity" however, is overloaded across various domains, which makes its meaning muddled and confusing. Across humanities it is used synonymously with related concepts such as self-identity in psychology, collective identity in sociology, and shared identity in political science. In business the word is sometimes used in place of brand identity.

In industry, identity, or the identity space, sometimes describe the greater space of market activities that have to do with identity systems. The open ended nature of the identity space consists of high level consumer, enterprise, and government segments, as well as sub-segments, such as consumer login, social media profiles, identity verification, access management, etc.

In technology circles, identity either refers to identity systems, or to specific instances of digital identity, representing real world people and entities as part of those systems. The notion of digital identity is closely related to security concepts of digital privacy, trust, verification, etc

When it comes to this word, context is always important.

## A simple definition

Identity is the information we associate with ourselves, other people and things.

We each have our own set of identities (self-identities) that we share with the world, depending on the context. For example we present one identity to our friends and family, and another to our professional colleagues.

We also identify other people and organizations, based on the identities (self-identities) they have put forward, but also with our own additions and subtractions, including judgments around reputation, intentions and trust level. For example we may now have a lower trust for Experian after hearing about their recent security breaches. We maintain long term connections at various levels of engagement and trust, with those people and organizations we deem worthy of future interaction.

We identify objects and things, somewhat similarly to above, but with possible ownership considerations, and without subjective judgments around direct intention and trust.

## A word with many meanings

At the root of it all, the cognitive process of identification assigns specific properties, characteristics, and intentions to things and beings we know or connect with. Cognitive identities are therefore, the most basic cognitive constructs associated with all things that are distinctly recognized. This meaning is what the simple definition in previous section most relies upon.

The one, and most important, instance of cognitive identity is that of the self, also known as self-identity, which is also used synonymously as such by psychologists. This is the concept referred to in the sentence: "She felt her identity evolve after having her first child".

Sociologists use identity, or collective identity, in the scope of social group membership. The following shows an example of its usage: "He was feeling more proud of his Asian-American identity". Collective identity is a subset of self-identity that pertains to group membership, and has significant consequences related to one's feelings of belonging and self-efficacy. 

Political scientists use identity, or shared identity, in aggregate form, in the context of social collective consciousness. For example shared identity is used here: "The African-American community's identity is partly defined by their common experience of discrimination". Shared identity has a prominent role in the understanding and wielding of identity politics.

In business marketing, identity, or brand identity, refer to the traits and characteristics that a business aspires to promote itself as. For example: "Apple's identity is synonymous with desirable devices, magical innovation, simple experiences, and trusted curation of technology". In a sense, brand identity is a form of perceived identity.

All of these different definitions have permeated throughout our culture, and have been confusing the everyday person's understanding of its meaning. It is thus important to be explicit about the context when discussing identity.

## Identity systems

Identity systems operate by defining, maintaining and using virtual representation of real world identities, such as in the case of social security system with SSN. A more specialized form of virtual identities are digital identities, such as social media profile, or login accounts. These are arrived at by translating the cognitive representations of specific identities into the virtual or digital domains, in the form of a social security account, or a Facebook account and user profile.

By using language we represent our thoughts in words, in order to communicate more effectively with others. Similarly, we use virtual identity artifacts, to help us communicate the concepts of identity and trust. As human societies, we have created and used identity systems, to make economic transactions more efficient, though easing the verification of digital identity and reputation of transaction participants.

Initially this was done at the scale of friends, family and tribe, using informal identity and reputation systems. In the past century or so we have been able to scale this even further to the level of nation states, by using large scale identity systems, such as the United States Social Security system. Furthermore, in the recent decades, we have improved the scale and efficiency of such systems with the use of digital technology, digital identity systems and digital identities.

## The identity industry

The identity space describe the greater space of market activities that have to do with identity systems. The use of the term identity space is also imprecise and can be clarified further. The space primarily consists of the following high level segments, defined by the customer type that the market serves:

- Consumer
- (Business and) enterprise
- Government (and institutions)

The consumer identity market segment, consist of multiple sub-segments including the following:

- Social networks
- Consumer login (and personal information)
- Password management

In the (business and) enterprise high level segment, some most prominent market sub-segments are:

- Customer identity access management (CIAM)
- Identity verification
- Enterprise authentication
- Others

## The wrap

As mentioned above, context is important. So in my field of work, identity is used to mean 3 distinct but related things. 1. Sometimes it is used to mean the identity space, that is, the market encompassing products and services within consumer, enterprise and government segments. 2. At other times, the word refers to identity systems such as the Facebook identity system for consumers, or Azure Active Directory used by enterprises as their primary employee directory. 3. Identity is also often used to mean a specific digital identity, such as someone's Facebook account and user profile.
