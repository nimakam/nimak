# What is identity﹖

Every time I tell people I work on **digital identity**, they look at me with the most perplexed expressions. The confusion comes from the fact that **identity** is one of the more abstract and overloaded terms in the history of technology, business and humanities. Unfortunately, and as a result, identity has also become a pseudo-buzz-word marketing tool that momentarily confuses and impresses the audience enough for the seller to attempt influencing them.

## In search of a definition

At the root of it all, **identity** is a most basic cognitive construct, assigned to all things that are distinctly recognized. And **identification** is the cognitive process of assigning specific properties, characteristics, and intentions to things and beings we know and/or connect with.

The most prominent instance of **cognitive identity** is that of the self, or **self-identity**, used synonymously by psychologists. Sociologists also use identity, or **collective identity**, to mean the subset of self-identity related to social group membership. Political scientists use the word identity, or **shared identity**, to represent aggregated notion of group-identity as collectively understood by any social consciousness. All these definitions of the word *identity* have permeated throughout the culture, and have been confusing the everyday person as to what it really means.

**Virtual identity** (represented by artifacts such as the social security number and driver's license), or its more specialized form, **digital identity** (represented by social media profile, or login accounts), are conceived by translating the cognitive concept of identity into the virtual domains such as physical identity documents, web identity, and enterprise digital identity.

Just as with the use of language, where virtualizing our thoughts into words helps humans communicate more effectively with others, use of virtual identity, helps communicate the concepts of identity and trust. As human societies, we have been creating virtual identity artifacts as tools to secure economic activities at scale, by making it easier to verify the identity and reputation of other participants.

## My definition

>Identity is the information we associate with ourselves, other entities (people and organizations) and objects.

We each have our own set of **expressed identities** that we share with the world selectively, depending on the context. For example we present one identity to our **friends** and **family**, and another to our professional **colleagues**.

We also identify other people and organizations, based on what identity they have put forward, but also with additions and subtractions, including judgments around **reputation**, **intentions** and **trust level**. We maintain **connections** with those **people** and **organizations** we deem worthy of future interactions, at various levels of engagement and trust.

We identify other objects without sophisticated and subjective judgments, and with ownership and usage considerations.
